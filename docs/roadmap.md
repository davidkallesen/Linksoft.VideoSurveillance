# 🗺️ Linksoft.VideoSurveillance Roadmap

## 🖥️ Linksoft.VideoSurveillance.WpfApp

A new WPF management application for the `Linksoft.VideoSurveillance.Api` server. Combines the management features of the existing Blazor WebAssembly UI with live multi-camera streaming and recording playback over HTTP.

### 💡 Motivation

The existing `Linksoft.Wpf.CameraWall.App` is a standalone desktop application that connects directly to cameras via RTSP/HTTP. The new `WpfApp` is a **client** for the REST API server, enabling:

- Centralized server-side camera management and recording
- Live camera streaming over HTTP/HLS from the server
- Remote management from any Windows machine on the network
- Recording playback streamed from the server's recording archive
